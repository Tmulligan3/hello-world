# hello-world
New to githup and web app development for Node.js, express, postgres css html and javascript
I have been a mainframe programmer for many years I know nothing about the PC world and am interested in learning how to build web application.  I wanted to start with simple step by step task that builds on learning pure javascript, node.js, css4, es6, html5 using postgres to store my data.  I don't rush at all so I take my time,  I have no job that requires this at this time.
I what to build a simple web page that is responsive and works on phones, tablets and desktops.  I am ok using notepad++, brakers and even visual studio code.  I have both windows 10 machine 64bit and Linux Ubuntu 19.10 version.  So my testing will be on those devices.
